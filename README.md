# NAND Title Manager
A basic title manager for the Nintendo DSi supporting both hiyaCFW's SDNAND and SysNAND, modified from JeffRuLz's Title Manager for HiyaCFW.

## WARNING
This can modify your internal system NAND! There is *always* a risk of **bricking**, albeit small, when you modify NAND. Please proceed with caution. Having Unlaunch installed is also strongly recommended as it will likely protect you if something manages to go wrong.

## Features
- Install DSiWare and homebrew onto your hiyaCFW SDNAND and SysNAND DSi Menus
- Delete system titles and others hidden from Data Management
- Backup and restore installed titles
- View basic title header info

## Notes
- Backup your SD card and your NAND! Nothing bad should happen, but this is an early release so who knows
- This cannot install cartridge games or older DS homebrew directly, for those you need to make [forwarders](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/ds-index/forwarders)
   - Always test your forwarders from TWiLight Menu++ or Unlaunch before installing to SysNAND
- Save files and legit TMDs can be used by giving them the following names, where `[rom name]` is the file name of the ROM *without* the extension
   - `public.sav` => `[rom name].pub`
   - `private.sav` => `[rom name].prv`
   - `banner.sav` => `[rom name].bnr`
   - `title.tmd` => `[rom name].tmd`
- If you want your DSiWare to work without RSA patches make sure to provide a legit TMD
   - Homebrew and DSiWare without a legit TMD require Unlaunch installed with its launcher patches enabled when installed to SysNAND
- This is only for DSi systems, not 3DS or DS
